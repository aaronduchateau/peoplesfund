                                            and the ability to use many functions of KeepTree.org, and potentially, at the sole discretion of

                                            who are offering trees for preservation or who have sold contracts for tree preservation. In
                                            addition, the loss of Membership Status will remove the ability of members to vote on posts to
                                            KeepTree.org and remove their ability to make posts to KeepTree.org. Herein, the word carbon
                                            refers to carbon dioxide, and sequestered carbon per year refers to the estimated amount of
                                            carbon dioxide that can be removed by a single tree per year is on the order of 50 pounds per
                                            year. Additionally, a very large tree can store more than 200 tons, where one ton is 2000
                                            pounds of carbon. The User who agrees to this binding legal contract understands that this

                                            The monetary damage
                                            done to the climate when a KeepTree.org slated for preservation occurs is evaluated as the rate
                                            per ton of sequestered carbon direct air capture projects launched by very major companies
                                            with a market capitalization over $10,000,000 that capture carbon from the air and sequester
                                            them underground in mineralized form. This price is currently $500 per ton of sequestered
                                            carbon, but is expected to be reduced to $300 per ton in the coming decades. This high agreed
                                            upon price does not include companies that temporarily sequester carbon dioxide for resale as
                                            compressed CO2 or for resale as wood products or other commercial products, like plastic or
                                            graphene. The amount of sequestered carbon in a tree that is slowly released back to the
                                            atmosphere after harvesting can exceed 200 tons for very large trees. As an example, the
                                            damage for fraudulently cutting down a 200 ton tree is $100,000 dollars. Additionally, people
                                            who commit fraud by selling a carbon sequestration contract may also be held liable for the
                                            tons of carbon that are not sequestered by the tree for the remainder of the contract period. In
                                            signing this agreement and acting as a Seller, the Seller acknowledges that value of the tree for
                                            carbon sequestration and storage currently far exceeds its market value as timber. A carbon
                                            credits Seller must own the property holding the tree for which they sell for carbon credits and
                                            they are vulnerable to a civil suit or small claims court action if they intentionally destroy a tree.
                                            Additionally, this person may be reported to legal authorities by KeepTree.org or by Members
                                            of KeepTree.org for fraud, identity theft, and other potential crimes with significant sentences,
                                            especially considering that carbon sequestration value of a typical tree under this contract is far
                                            higher than the value of an unprotected tree that is cut down or fatally vandalized in a manner
                                            that violates tree law. By electronically signing this agreement, any Seller acknowledges that
                                            the financial damages incurred by breaking the contract are likely far greater than the timber
                                            value of the tree and far value than the amount that they were paid to preserve the tree.
                                            However, the legal action must be taken by a Member Buyer who purchased carbon
                                            sequestration and storage from a Member Seller and was harmed by the fraud committed by a
                                            Member Seller. KeepTree.org reserves the right to host micro-litigation finance projects that

                                            In the future, additional legal contracts that allow buyers and sellers to interact may
                                            made available on KeepTree.org that have additional clauses and requirements. One of these
                                            contracts may be an Ecological Carbon Credits and Storage Mortgage that may entail a lien

                                            destroyed. Potential new contracts do not void the language of this agreement. KeepTree.org
                                            reserves the right to partner with third-party banks to produce an Ecological Carbon Credits and

                                            and Investigator status. As a further constraint, no photos or videos of people may be taken or
                                            preserved when investigating whether or not a Seller has harvested a tree. No drone flights
                                            may be taken when people are present outside on the property, and if people move outside
                                            during an overflight, the drone flight must immediately cease, video recording should be turned
                                            off, and the drone should return to the nearest public street or public place with an airspace
                                            that allows drone flights. Further, in some areas, like those near airports, the FAA imposes a
                                            flight ceiling less than 200 feet. In these areas, Investigators are prohibited from a drone
                                            overflight when investigating whether a Seller’s tree is still sequestering carbon, regardless of
                                            whether they have rights to do so as a drone operator. Investigators who violate this risk losing
                                            their Investigator and Member status. All Sellers agree that photographs or videos of trees that

                                            they sold for carbon credits can be taken by Investigators who are standing in a street or public
                                            place but only at a time when no people are present outside or visible through windows, and
                                            only between the ours of 11 am and 4 pm local time. It is understood by sellers that
                                            Investigators and Members can make posts promoting the results of an investigation so long as
                                            the post complies with the Terms of Service of KeepTree.org. Any photos or videos posted by
                                            an Investigator or Member should include no people, unless they are taking camera or drone
                                            photos or video of themselves by a tree or a stump. Keep tree assumes no liability for

                                            KeepTree.org reserves to implement a feature called KeepTree.org
                                            Carbon Credits at any point in time in the future. KeepTree.org makes no guarantees that it will
                                            do so or provide any timeline should it decide to do so. It should be understood that these
                                            carbon credits have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash. It should also be
                                            understood that the value of these internal carbon credits that a user has acquired can increase
                                            or decrease at any point in time by a mechanism that is chosen at the sole discretion of
                                            KeepTree.org. However, at any point in time, KeepTree.org may or may not exchange these
                                            carbon credits with broader carbon credits markets at a broader floating rate. The potential
                                            benefit of such a change in policy might be to better allow individuals to ethically participate in
                                            national or international carbon credits markets. If any such external transaction occurs,
                                            KeepTree.org will keep 4% of the credits and distribute the rest to Members with a weighting
                                            that is solely determined by KeepTree.org. It is understood by the User that KeepTree carbon
                                            credits have zero monetary value right now, and even if they have an exchange value on
                                            external markets at some point in the future, KeepTree.org reserves the right to withdraw from
                                            any external carbon credits market that may reduce or eliminate the value of any KeepTree
                                            Carbon Credits. However, it is the intention of KeepTree.org to make the value of KeepTree
                                            Carbon Credits accurately represent a person’s offset of their own carbon footprint. For
                                            example, an average American has a yearly carbon footprint of 60 tons of CO2 per year, with
                                            lower income Americans having a much smaller carbon footprint. A single acre of preserved
                                            forest can sequester up to 40 tons of CO2 per year, while storing thousands of tons of CO2 that
                                            would be released to the atmosphere if the CO2 were released upon decay if the forest were
                                            harvested or ceased to exist. It is the goal of KeepTree.org to allow Members to ethically offset
                                            their own carbon footprint, and allow landowners to affordably preserve the carbon
                                            sequestering plants, soil, and trees on their own land. It is the goal of KeepTree.org to not wait
                                            for countries, trading blocks, and multinational organizations to set up ethical and fraud-
                                            resistant carbon credits markets, and instead allow individuals themselves to take direct action
                                            to sequester carbon dioxide, remove pollutants, and preserve native ecosystems.</p>

                                            Seller contracts to value those carbon credits. In such cases, KeepTree.org will keep 4% of the
                                            U.S. dollars remaining after currency transfers after such a sale. The remaining 96% percent will
                                            be credited to the Seller and Buyer at a floating ratio that can optionally be fixed by
                                            KeepTree.org, or that can be allowed to fluctuate as a market between Buyers and Sellers.
                                            However, it is understood by the User that KeepTree.org has not made the decision to sell
                                            carbon credits to third parties at any point in time and no guarantees can be made that any
                                            Buyer, Seller, or Member will receive additional income related to the sale of carbon credits at
                                            any point in time. The decision of whether to engage in external carbon credits markets or to
                                            disengage from them is at the sole discretion of KeepTree.org at all points in time. The sale
                                            prices of any carbon credits is solely determined by KeepTree.org, and it retains all control over

                                            how to value those carbon credits, which may or may not include any future internal market. If

                                            drone, and satellite data that is legally acquired and posted to KeepTree.org for artificial
                                            intelligence training and development. The good-faith goal of using this data is to improve the
                                            value and integrity and value of carbon credits markets, including the micro transactions that
                                            occur between Sellers and Buyers on KeepTree.org. KeepTree.org reserves the right to
                                            selectively sell access to neural networks that are trained on this data to reputable research
                                            scientists, companies, and non-profit organizations. Any future developments in this effort may
                                            increase or decrease the carbon sequestration value of trees owned by any member for any
                                            reason, including the estimated likelihood for a user to commit fraud as a Seller or perceived
                                            fire damage due to diverse reasons, such as increases or decreases in the fire danger to any
                                            forests, pest infestation risks, and fungal infestation risks. KeepTree.org intends to use this data
                                            to inform landowners methods that they can use to preserve the value of their trees as Sellers,
                                            to improve the value of sequestration to buyers, and to use statistics and artificial intelligence
                                            to determine which transactions are more or less likely to randomly or intentionally directed for
                                            promotion to an Investigator. More broadly, KeepTree.org intends to use artificial intelligence,
                                            mathematics, and statistics to ideally increase the carbon sequestration value of living
                                            ecosystems, though the results of such analyses may act to reduce the carbon store value of
                                            any terrestrial or marine ecosystem.

                                            If a fire, tornado, earthquake, destroys a living tree under a Seller’s contract, the
                                            seller is required to photographically document this damage before cutting down the tree. Any
                                            logs from that tree greater than 3 inches in diameter must be stored outside and unsheltered
                                            on the property for the duration of the Seller’s contract, with the intention that this tree store
                                            carbon and reincorporate its many nutrients back into the soil to fertilize the rapid growth of
                                            new trees. Trees that are damaged by acts of God that are within 100 feet of a structure are
                                            exempt from the requirement that all logs greater than 3 inches in diameter must be stored on
                                            the property to encourage the growth of new trees. In the event that such trees are damaged
                                            by such acts of God and the Seller follows these requirements, then Seller is exempt from being
                                            sued by the Buyer for fraudulently harvesting a tree. However, such events may or may not
                                            damage a Member’s Reputation score. It is expected that Sellers will take reasonable action to

                                            prevent their trees from being fire damaged, that may include limbing up the protected tree,
                                            cutting brush around the base of the tree, and cutting down smaller trees that hug the base of
                                            the tree that is being protected for its carbon storage and sequestration value. A Seller who
                                            complies with these rules is declared exempt from legal prosecution by a Buyer or a group of
